generate_initial_avs.py takes a fairly simple template file to automate 
repetitive script generation, such as for a weekly show. There are two special
fields, [[d2v]] and [[trims:N]], where d2v is replaced with the d2v supplied,
and N is an integer corresponding to the number of segments in the episode.
N instances of Trim(0,0) will be generated. Returns epnum.avs for handing off
to ParallelEncoding.py

Usage: ./generate_initial_script.py template d2v epnum


ParallelEncoding.py is a tool for encoding multiple segmented lossless h.264 
files from a given avs. Expanded to work with TheFluff's hacked ffms2 for 10bit
lossless capabilities.

The format of the output template is similar to the initial output template.
[[lossless]] triggers the output of the lossless source lines, and [[OutDir]]
inserts the path of the output folder into a line, primarily useful for TextSub,
which needs a full absolute path. The rest of the file should be whatever you use
to encode your final versions.

Usage: ParallelEncoding.py [options] input.avs output_template

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t THREADS, --threads=THREADS
                        Number of parallel encodes to spawn
  -m AVS_MEM_PER_THREAD, --max-memory=AVS_MEM_PER_THREAD
                        Value for SetMemoryMax() in threads
  -w, --wine            Encoding on linux, so use wine
  -n, --no-avs2yuv      Do not use avs2yuv. Strange default action requires
                        explicitly turning off.
  -d, --tenbit          Turns on hi10p mode. [default=False]
